# hello-world

I am just starting to learn some programnming. So don't pay too much attention to my code :-)
Questions I probably can't answer too good yet. Feedback and tips are always more than welcome.

Currently (January 7, 2017 half way) I am working on Learning Python the Hard Way by Zed A. Shaw.
